# Boilerplate
Collection of my own functions and utilities written so often they deserved to go into their own library. Yet only those, which would assumingly benefit the broadest audience as well. Always maintained to consider the latest features of C++ standard and [Cpp Core Guidelines][0].
> [!ATTENTION]
> While this library is a one-file only, it uses directly [Guidline Support Library(GSL)][1] (and provides an indirect access to it as well with Cmake's `FetchContent`).\
> Reference point for 'latest features' is `LLVM/clang` compiler.
